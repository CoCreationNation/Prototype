                We at Co-Creation Nation are re-imagining civic engagement as more than just a “trending phrase.”   For us, new civic engagement builds a sense of community and brings people of all backgrounds at the table to deliberate solutions that work for them at the local level.  We don’t just want to hear people’s opinion about what’s wrong, we want them to participate as stewards and advocates in shaping their community’s future. This kind of civic engagement should involve both — the voices historically silent by lack of opportunity, and the influential voices exercised by power brokers.  Reimagining civic engagement is at the core of how communities can and want to reinvent and manage assets that serve everyone — because that’s the way we reach common ground in the first place.  That’s the way, we together can say what we can live with.  It is never about you and I being right or wrong.  It is about you and I being civic about what is best for most of us. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In our work, we’ve identified promising stories for effective civic engagement. These stories shine a light on how reimagining civic engagement can be both an <i>input</i> and an <i>outcome</i> of investments in our communities — and perhaps most importantly, they can inspire us to heal forward collectively.

                    Prior to the pandemic, The Brown Family, a multi-generation household in the Lowell neighborhood of Central Fresno, CA, is enduring the hardships exarcebated by lockdowns and social distancing measures used to contain the spread of Coronavirus.  Mr. Brown, the primary breadwinner, was laid off from his cleaning job at a retail store 200 miles away.  Few months later, as an essential worker, went to work to a meat processor where he contracted Covid.  Mrs. Brown had to find a part-time job in a convenience store while balancing taking care of her illed husband and three children aged 4, 7, and 10.  Mrs. Brown, being budget conscious, says, "I am eager to get a living-wage paying job but I don't have the skills. I want to reskill to support my family.  I pray for God to help me."  Despite her strong faith, Mrs. Brown is too far away from the closest workforce training center to apply for training programs. With no reliable transportation, childcare services and steady Internet connection, Mrs. Brown has learned that working with the ecosystem at  Co-Creation Nation, she will be able to connect faster with her local community leaders and institutions.

            Lawrence James, Pastor at The Pink House, First Prebysterian Church of Fresno, is a trusted community leader among the youth, seniors and particularly black single mothers and mothers of color.  Working with Co-Creation Nation, Pastor James has recruited local volunteers to adapt an old school bus with a WIFI Hub to connect donated chromo books.  From 10 AM to 3PM, local residents can use the Internet to fill applications for public services, jobs or medical appointments.  "I wish innovation and technology in this country finds us" —  says Pastor James in hope to see more support from public and private stakeholder to his community.

                <p class="card-text">
                    A graduate from Harvard, Clara Rodriguez, has a deep understanding of Lowell neighborhood needs because her parents were born and raise in Fresno.  Despite her ties to the area, Clara often faces distrust from the community.  Working with Co-Creation Nation, Clara is able to get involved community residents and leaders in discussions that promote local economic development. "When everyone, seniors, children, parents, teachers, and others seat at the table in the beginning of a project proposal, I can listen to all voices, and understand better what the community needs and wants." "When residents can see by themselves that I am trying to meet them half-way, my hope is that they can trust our desire to promote economic activity for everyone," Clara states.  This is why how I envision to emerge as an Intentional Citizen post-pandemic.
